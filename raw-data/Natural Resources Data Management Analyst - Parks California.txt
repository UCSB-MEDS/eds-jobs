ORGANIZATION BACKGROUND
Parks California is a new organization working to ensure that our state’s parks thrive. From redwood groves and desert springs to lighthouses and ghost towns, we are working with our partners to make California parks more welcoming, accessible, and relevant to all visitors. Managing these assets for nearly 40 million residents and millions more annual visitors takes collective work. Park managers cannot do it alone. Parks California harnesses skills and resources—and California’s renowned ingenuity—to help our state, regional, and local parks thrive and evolve. Parks California coalesces a diverse set of partners to make this vision a reality. Parks California is committed to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout the organization and its programs.

CA State Parks generates ecological monitoring data in 212 parks, many with significant natural resources, and has several long-term ecological monitoring programs, including the Management Unit Datasheet Database System, and Weed Information Management System, as well as data collected using Early Detection Rapid Response protocols. Data coordination for these programs requires a diversity of strategies, which are strengthened through communication and transfer of knowledge between partners and programs.
