Methane Remote Sensing Scientist - EDF
With world attention on both the environment and the economy, Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) is where policymakers and business leaders turn for win-win solutions. By focusing on strong science, uncommon partnerships and market-based approaches, we tackle urgent threats with practical solutions. We are one of the world’s largest environmental organizations, with more than two million members and a staff of approximately 700 scientists, economists, policy experts, and other professionals around the world. We operate in 22 geographies with unique projects running across four programs. You will be part of a vibrant workplace where innovation and results are a way of life.
EDF envisions a world in which people from all backgrounds and experiences feel connected to the environmental challenges we face and are engaged in creating durable, equitable solutions. We seek talented candidates who share our Core Values of Respect, Results, Innovation, Optimism, and Integrity, and support our Commitment to Diversity.  
EDF has set an ambitious goal to achieve a 45% cut in global methane pollution from the Oil and Gas supply chain by 2025 in an effort to reduce the rate of warming we will experience over the next 20 years, equivalent to closing one third of the world’s coal fired power plants. Towards this goal EDF has a global strategy that includes catalyzing scientific studies that illuminate the scope of the problem and facilitate significant methane reductions. A new satellite mission, MethaneSAT, is being developed by a wholly-owned subsidiary of EDF, which will map and quantify anthropogenic methane emissions.
OVERALL FUNCTION
EDF Office of the Chief Scientist seeks a Scientist with proven research, analysis, and writing skills to work collaboratively with external and EDF scientists, as well as decision makers (governments and industry) on policy-relevant research that characterizes methane emissions from global oil and gas infrastructure using remote sensing data from existing and future satellite missions. The selected candidate will (i) lead and coordinate remote sensing related projects for methane emission quantification, (ii) help EDF stay at the cutting-edge of remote sensing tools and applications, (iii) integrate data from remote sensing and other methane measurement platforms. The Scientist will work with EDF’s Office of the Chief Scientist in close collaboration with the Energy Program on projects related to methane emissions from global oil and gas infrastructure.
KEY RESPONSIBILITIES
* Lead research and analysis of satellite remote sensing data to quantify methane emissions from anthropogenic sources with a focus on oil/gas infrastructure.
* Coordinate and collaborate with scientists and policy experts within EDF and from academia, industry and research organizations internationally involved in remote sensing of methane emissions.
* Support integration of remote sensing with other methane measurement platforms (e.g. ground-based measurements, airborne measurements, emission inventories).
* Participate in the analysis and writing of papers in peer-reviewed journals.
* Support development of monitoring, reporting and verification frameworks for oil and gas methane emissions.
* Remain at the cutting-edge of climate science and up-to-date with the scientific literature; build and maintain relevant scientific networks.
* Ensure scientific accuracy of EDF generated materials.
* Attend and represent EDF at external meetings; interacting with scientists and the scientific community at large.
* Independently support other “rapid response” and/or project development efforts on an as-needed basis.
* Advance EDF DEIJ goals in which people from all backgrounds and experiences feel connected, included, and empowered to address the environmental challenges we face. This includes fostering equitable systems and empowering diverse constituencies both internally and externally.
* Willingness to travel.
REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS

* Excellent written and oral communication skills in English.
* Initiates and maintains extensive contacts within the scientific community.
* Ability to synthesize, interpret, and communicate scientific data in an advocacy setting and for non-scientific populations.
* Exceptional personal organization and attention to detail; ability to work independently and as part of a diverse, geographically dispersed team.
* Experience in performing rigorous analysis with short deadlines in support of highly visible work.
* The ability to communicate complex ideas in writing and orally to multiple stakeholders with different levels of expertise, including the public and industry.  
* Demonstrates self-awareness, cultural competency and inclusivity, and ability to work with colleagues and stakeholders across diverse cultures and backgrounds.
PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS
* Experience quantifying Methane emissions from oil/gas related infrastructure using remote sensing.
* Understanding of atmospheric modeling and/or inverse modeling
* Knowledge about environmental issues associated with the oil and gas industry, especially air emissions;
* Familiarity with emission inventories.
* Working proficiency in a language in addition to English is a plus
