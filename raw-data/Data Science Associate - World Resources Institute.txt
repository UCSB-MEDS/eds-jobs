Program Overview


The Global Restoration Initiative works to mobilize action to restore economic and ecological vitality to degraded farms, forests, mangroves, and peatland around the globe. We are a team of nearly 80 across Africa, Asia, Latin America and Washington, DC working to accelerate this locally led, globally important movement in three ways: 1. Inform: Create new data and communicate insights at the global, national and landscape stakeholders 2. Enable: Shift policies and incentives by helping decisions makers solve each other’s challenges 3. Invest: Accelerate projects and businesses and match them with funders to start closing the funding gap All of which are led through partners of the scaling platforms—AFR100 and Initiative 20x20.
WRI Overview 
World Resources Institute (WRI) is an independent, nonprofit global research organization that turns big ideas into action at the nexus of environment, economic opportunity and human well-being. We are working to address seven critical challenges that the world must overcome this decade in order to secure a sustainable future for people and the planet: climate change, energy, food, forests, water, sustainable cities, and the ocean. 
We are passionate. We value our diversity of interests, skills and backgrounds. We have a flexible work environment. And we share a common goal to catalyze change that will improve the lives of people. Our shared ideals are at the core of our approach. They include: integrity, innovation, urgency, independence and respect. 
The foundation of our work is delivering high-quality research, data, maps and analysis to solve the world’s greatest environment and international development challenges, and improve people’s lives. We work with leaders in government, business and civil society to drive ambitious action and create change on the ground. Equally important, we bring together partners to develop breakthrough ideas and scale-up solutions for far-reaching, enduring impact.  
We have been growing rapidly: our staff has doubled in size over the past 5 years and our operating budget is now $150 million. Founded in 1982, WRI has a global staff of 1,000+ people with work spanning 60 countries. We have offices in Africa, Brazil, China, Europe, India, Indonesia, Mexico and the United States as well as a growing presence in other countries and regions.
