The mission of The Walt Disney Company is to entertain, inform and inspire people around the globe through the power of unparalleled storytelling, reflecting the iconic brands, creative minds and innovative technologies that make ours the world’s premier entertainment company.
Disney’s longstanding commitment to social responsibility (CSR) is an important part of who we are as a Company.
Consumers are increasingly more conscious of the environmental and social impacts of the products, content and experiences they choose, and demand more from businesses.
