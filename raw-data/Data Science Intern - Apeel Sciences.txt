Data Science Intern, Summer 2021
Santa Barbara, California, United States
Company Background
Since 2012, founder James Rogers has been on a mission to tackle the global Food Waste Crisis with a goal of providing a more sustainable, equitable path forward for the global food system. Apeel is an edible protective layer that extends fruits’ and vegetables’ shelf-life. Apeel-covered fruits and vegetables spoil slower and require less refrigeration, and the plant-derived peel reduces the use of plastic and other products harmful to the planet. Apeel pulls material from the natural skins, peels, seeds, and pulp found on fruits and vegetables, to create the extra protective peel. The thin layer slows down water loss and oxidation, which can help keep those fruits and vegetables from browning and spoiling.
Company Culture
At Apeel Sciences, we look to nature to help the global food system improve quality, reduce waste, and ensure an abundant future for our planet.  Apeel is comprised of highly talented, deeply passionate, and tight-knit team members who are excited by the opportunity to challenge the status quo, obsessed with solving problems, and truly seek to positively change how we feed the world.
Our people are fundamental to our company’s success and continued growth. If you are ready for an opportunity to jump in, take ownership, and drive meaningful outcomes in a highly collaborative, communicative, and dynamic environment, we would love to connect with you!
