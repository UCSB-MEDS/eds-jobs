* and the current drought management practices and drought preparedness.
The candidate will support the project in collecting historical and real-time hydrological observations (river discharge, groundwater, water level data) in the Alpine space region, implementing a data infrastructure and a web-gis that will feed the ADO platform. He will also analyze the collected data to derive hydrological regime and identify historical droughts.
 
Tasks:
* Gathering hydrological observations from national and regional data providers in the Alpine Space
* Keep contacts with the projects partners and data providing institutions
* Organizing in the ADO platform and quality check collected data
* Developing interactive visualization tools
* Documentation / Report writing
