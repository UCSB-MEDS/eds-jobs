Position: The position will provide key support and insight across the company, from modeling, data visualization and analytics to integration between frontend and backend architecture, as well as developing key innovative modeling infrastructure. We view this position as the glue between core areas of product development: data visualization, modeling, analytics, and deployment architecture. The position provides the opportunity to have hands-on involvement with everything the start-up deals with and has the potential for substantial growth. 


Team: We are looking for creative, big thinkers ready to join our start-up team -- people who are interested in employing modern technological, data and programming tools to help solve critical problems at the intersection of water and climate change.

Besides a healthy compensation package: being part of a dynamite, tight-knit team that is focused on making an impact and getting in on the ground floor of a new business.
