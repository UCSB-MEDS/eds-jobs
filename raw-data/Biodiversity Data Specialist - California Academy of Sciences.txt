POSITION SUMMARY: 
The Biodiversity Data Analyst/ Scientist designs innovative approaches to integrate, analyze, model, synthesize, and visualize community-contributed biodiversity observations arising from the activities of the Center for Biodiversity and Community Science and the iNaturalist community, with the ultimate goal to reveal patterns of biodiversity change and produce actionable biodiversity insights in California and globally. The Biodiversity Data Analyst/ Scientist is in charge of extracting important biodiversity information held in community-contributed data and museum collections and translating it into insights relevant to research and management of natural resources. In addition, the Biodiversity Data Analyst/ Scientist leads the development of innovative tools to mobilize, analyze, and visualize biodiversity data from community science and natural history collections within Academy-wide initiatives aimed at informing critical science, conservation, and decision making. 
The Center for Biodiversity and Community Science uses the biodiversity observation recording and social network platform iNaturalist for the bulk of our data collection.  The Biodiversity Data Analyst/ Scientist will lead the development of data analyses that integrate community science collected and museum specimen species occurrence (presence only) data with available environmental data (temperature, salinity, pH, etc), to build predictive spatial models for species. In addition to providing overall expertise in working with large biodiversity data sets (primarily species occurrence data) across the organization, the Biodiversity Data Analyst/ Scientist will work on three specific projects: 
   1. Early Warning and Forecasting System for Biodiversity Change on the California Coast: Building on preliminary work, the Postdoctoral Researcher will use community collected species occurrence data to complete a tool that forecasts changes in species abundance based on climate projections.  40% time
   2. Bringing Urban Biodiversity Data and Social Equity to Conservation Planning in the Bay Area: The researcher will build species distribution models using community collected data for 10 Bay Area species and be a key member of a team incorporating species occurrence data into a regional planning tool.  20% time
   3. Visualizations for Academy Strategic Initiatives: The researcher will build interactive visualizations, as needed, using collections and community science data for the Thriving California and the Islands 2030 initiatives.  25% time
   4. Other projects as needed  15% time
The Center for Biodiversity and Community Science is within the Academy’s Institute for Biodiversity Science & Sustainability. We are committed to developing a community of naturalists working together to document biodiversity, connecting people to their local nature, and simultaneously collecting data critical to science and management. We accomplish these goals through a variety of programs including community bioblitzes, long-term intertidal monitoring, City Nature Challenge, and Snapshot Cal Coast, which scaffold collecting biodiversity observations using the iNaturalist platform with in-person community science field experiences. Our team is also dedicated to building best practices around engagement through community science and is actively working on research related to science learning and development of environmental science agency through participation in community science. The Center for Biodiversity and Community Science has delivered a broad range of innovative projects since 2012, reaching tens of thousands of people and collecting millions of species occurrence records throughout California and beyond.
We are committed to ensuring diversity, equity, accessibility, and inclusion are intrinsic to Academy culture and operations, from recruitment and retention to science and advocacy.
