GEOSPATIAL ANALYST
Variable or Remote (San Francisco, CA, Austin, TX, New York, NY, Washington, DC, Boston, MA, Boulder, CO)
MethaneSAT, LLC, an affiliate of Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) is launching a high performance, purpose-built satellite—MethaneSAT—to map and measure oil and gas methane emissions worldwide, with the potential to assess emissions from the full range of man-made sources. The satellite will enable us to gather methane emissions data on a global scale and with data from other sources, locate and quantify these emissions. Data from MethaneSAT will help EDF reduce methane emissions by 45% by 2025 and holds the potential to help reduce the temperature of our planet by as much as 0.5 degrees C by the end of the century. This could be the most impactful environmental project yet conceived.
Overall Function
MethaneSAT, LLC is seeking a Geospatial Analyst with proven geospatial analytical and research skills in support of a major satellite mission to advance the development of source attribution of methane emissions from the global oil and gas sector using geospatial data and analytics. The Geospatial Analyst will be a key team member in the MethaneSAT team and will work closely with EDF’s Office of the Chief Scientist and EDF scientists, technologists and external partners from academia and industry on the development of a global oil and gas infrastructure database as well as source attribution studies and data analytics related to the MethaneSAT mission. The Geospatial Analyst will work on interdisciplinary projects at the intersection of large-scale datasets, geospatial analytics, remote sensing, and machine learning. This position will report to the Scientist in MethaneSAT, LLC and will work closely with other MethaneSAT, LLC staff, key contractors, partners, and EDF staff.
Key responsibilities 
Specific tasks will include, but are not limited to:
* Compile, integrate, and analyze multiple and disparate spatial datasets, including publicly reported oil and gas data by governments and companies, high-resolution satellite imagery, and methane measuring satellite datasets to support the development of a global oil and gas infrastructure database.
* Create automated geoprocessing workflows and conduct geospatial, statistical, and other advanced data analyses for EDF’s oil and gas infrastructure mapping and methane emission inventory projects and prepare data visualizations and reports of findings.
* Ensure high degree of confidence in the projects’ data products including but not limited to developing and implementing QA/QC strategies regarding the oil and gas infrastructure database.
* Support and manage key components of ongoing projects with internal and external partners, including from academia, industry, and research organizations.
