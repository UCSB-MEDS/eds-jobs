About SilviaTerra
SilviaTerra helps mission-driven companies buy carbon credits from American forest owners.  Based on a decade of work with America's largest landowners, our data-driven platform brings gigatons of new carbon offsets to market.  Our mission is to work with every forest owner to unlock the full value of every acre.

We are backed by some of the world’s leading VC firms who were early investors in companies like Twitter, Etsy, Kickstarter, and Coinbase. Our global team of foresters, scientists, and technologists hails from leading research institutions and high growth technology startups.


We are looking for passionate, collaborative, and entrepreneurial individuals to join the team. If you like fast-paced environments and want to help us build the future of forestry, then we’d love to speak to you!


Job Description
SilviaTerra is built on terabytes of geospatial data, and we are rapidly expanding to integrate new types and structure of data into our work. Our Basemap dataset is our flagship data product- a high-resolution dataset of estimated number, species and size of trees across the continental United States.  Basemap and its derivative metrics are critical components that underpin transactions on our carbon market. 


This role is an integral part of that work, primarily responsible for improving and extending spatially explicit forecasts of annual forest change, landowner behavior, and harvest likelihood. The initial focus of this work is North America, with planned expansion globally. The Data Scientist - Econometrician will work closely with the rest of our team of forest biometricians and data scientists. 




The successful candidate for this role is creative, innovative, quantitative, and thorough. This is a role for a strong individual contributor who wants ownership of a critical component of an innovative new forest carbon market.


You will be successful in this role if you are:


- Eager to do applied work with real-world impact
- Comfortable working with messy datasets from many sources
- Able to tackle a challenge, deliver results, and continually improve your own products
- Ready to design and produce a meaningful, data-driven and spatially explicit model of the world around you
- Experienced with natural resource management, or can talk us through your experience learning and succeeding in work on new subject matter


Come join us as we democratize natural capital markets for landowners!


This is a remote position.
Key Responsibilities
   * Take the lead on improving and extending baseline forest change datasets to inform high-resolution, spatially explicit estimates of available carbon for marketplace transactions
