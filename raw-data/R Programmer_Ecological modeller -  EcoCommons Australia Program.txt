In this exciting new role, you will develop scripts, packages and workflows needed to complete key analytical tasks in ecological and biodiversity modelling within the R programming language. You will be responsible for delivering standardised, reproducible software tools, and supporting the integration of those methods with the wider EcoCommons platform. This role is an opportunity to support and shape an emerging piece of Australia's scientific infrastructure, while drawing on established skills in quantitative ecology, ecological modelling, conservation or related fields. As a member of both EcoCommons and the ALA Science and Decision Support team, you will have a unique opportunity to work with Australian and international collaborators to enhance Australia's cloud computing capabilities.
