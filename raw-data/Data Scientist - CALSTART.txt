CALSTART is seeking a highly motivated, experienced, and results-oriented Entry-Level Data Scientist (DS) who will play a critical role in developing CALSTART’s data storage infrastructure, including maintaining an application programming interface (API) for users to access a wide variety of data derived from clean transportation programs throughout the country. The DS will create automated workflows to ingest data from a variety of sources before loading into a relational database and/or storing in raw formats in a backed-up file system. The DS will develop routines to calculate metrics at the levels of vehicle, fleet, project, and various spatial hierarchies (i.e. zip code or county). These metrics will then be served through an API for access internally and externally by authorized clients via web and desktop applications. The DS will work with CALSTART staff, external parties, and prospective users to develop the workflows, API, and reports.
The Data Scientist will also:
* Code in a scientific programming language (e.g. R or Python) to the degree of having documented functions in a package (e.g. R library or Python module)
* Create and populate relational databases (e.g. PostgreSQL) including forming queries in SQL
* Consume APIs by constructing web requests, possibly first authenticating with OAuth, and digesting responses in JSON with a programming language
* Maintaining a RESTful API using a framework (e.g. R Plumber or Python Flask)
* Version code using git and collaborate on issues through GitHub
* Contribute to the strategic development of information technology infrastructure
* Develop technical guidance documenting products and services created
* Organize and submit reports to CALSTART staff
* Present architecture and use of APIs to potential users.
