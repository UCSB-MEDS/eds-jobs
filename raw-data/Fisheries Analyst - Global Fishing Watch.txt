General Summary
Global Fishing Watch is an independent, international nonprofit organization. We are committed to advancing ocean sustainability and stewardship through increasing transparency. We do this by offering, for free, data and near real-time tracking of global commercial fishing activity, supporting new science and research, and boosting global cooperation on ocean transparency. Our ambition is to provide an unprecedented global picture of fishing activity by monitoring the large industrial vessels responsible for around 75 percent of the global catch, and developing our platform to track smaller vessels.
Established in early 2019 the Data and Analysis Cell has quickly grown into a global team of fisheries analysts providing open source analysis, training and data products to fisheries managers in governments and intergovernmental institutions. The team's aim is to remove barriers to accessing open source fisheries data whilst promoting transparency and empowering fisheries managers to make the best decision with the best data available.
