Location: Washington, DC, US, 20016
Company: American University
Summary/Objective
The Seafood and Food Security Data Scientist will join an interdisciplinary team focused on seafood production and trade. Seafood plays an important role in global food security, providing nearly 20% of global animal protein and supplying essential fatty acids and micronutrients. Seafood is also among the most highly-traded foods and the seafood sector is evolving with the rapid growth in aquaculture, geographical shifts in trade, and increasing commoditization and vertical integration. This research team brings together global trade data, local consumption data, and environmental impact data to understand the opportunities and risks of seafood globalization for sustainable production and food security.  


The Seafood and Food Security Data Scientist will lead the open data and reproducible science components of this research program. Responsibilities include data management, improving reproducible workflows, exploring opportunities to leverage new data sources, interfacing with a front-end developer for a database website, assisting database users, and helping coordinate database-related events. There are also opportunities to engage with students in the Data Science program and student researchers working on seafood trade data projects.  


This position is based at American University in Washington, DC and is supervised by Dr. Jessica Gephart, however the Seafood and Food Security Data Scientist will interact with a network of interdisciplinary and international scholars. This is a grant-funded position and continuation is dependent upon securing external funding. The Seafood and Food Security Data Scientist has opportunities to contribute to scholarly publications, learn new data skills, network with the DC data science, fisheries, food system, and environment communities, and collaborate with transdisciplinary teams. Successful applicants have either extensive experience in the food security and fisheries space and an interest in deepening data science skills or significant experience in the data science space with an interest in deepening their knowledge of food security and/or fisheries.
