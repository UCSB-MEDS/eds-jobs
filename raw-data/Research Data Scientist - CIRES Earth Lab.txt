CIRES Earth Lab Research Data Scientist
Requisition Number: 29628
Location: Boulder, Colorado
Employment Type: Research Faculty
Schedule: Full-Time
Date Posted: 07-Apr-2021


Job Summary
The Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) in Boulder, Colorado is seeking a Data Scientist to work in the Earth Lab.
The chosen candidate will assist researchers and students with Earth data management, data science, and visualization by conducting custom project-specific analyses and developing generic libraries for broader use. Analytics methods include statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence for computer vision, natural language processing, and other deep learning applications. The applicant will contribute to collaborative and open-source code and R or Python package development. A primary aim of this role is to use emerging techniques in data science to integrate different datasets (remote sensing, eDNA, site inventory, social media, etc) across scales from microbes to continents. This is a relatively new area of Earth Science, so the candidate need not be a specialist on all aspects of the problem but should be willing to learn and to show initiative. We use state-of-the-art computing that uses existing cyber-infrastructure investments including high-performance compute and cloud services.
The candidate should have excellent technical and communication skills and be comfortable working in a team environment.
This position will be in Boulder, Colorado, with an office at Earth Lab under the direction of the Analytics Hub Director.
The University of Colorado Boulder is committed to building a culturally diverse community of faculty, staff, and students dedicated to contributing to an inclusive campus environment. We are an Equal Opportunity employer, including veterans and individuals with disabilities.
Who We Are
Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES)
* CU-Boulder’s Cooperative Institute for Research on Environmental Science (CIRES) provides data science for a number of research initiatives around the campus. At CIRES, more than 800 environmental scientists work to understand the dynamic Earth system, including people’s relationship with the planet. CIRES is a partnership of NOAA and the University of Colorado Boulder, and our areas of expertise include weather and climate, changes at the Earth’s poles, air quality and atmospheric chemistry, water resources, and solid Earth sciences. Our vision is to be instrumental in ensuring a sustainable future environment by advancing scientific and societal understanding of the Earth system.
Earth Lab is part of CIRES and CU-Boulder’s Grand Challenge: Our Space, Our Future. Earth Lab’s mission is to harness the data revolution using Earth observations from aerospace platforms (drone, aircraft, and space) and other sources (e.g., social media, etc.) to better understand the pace and pattern of environmental change. Earth Lab: 
* Capitalizes on the data deluge from Space to accelerate global environmental change science; 
* Reduces environmental risk and surprise by understanding and predicting slow and abrupt Earth system change; and,
* Trains a new generation of data scientists in Earth analytics.
What Your Key Responsibilities Will Be
* Consult with and advise scientific researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder on efficient, appropriate, and powerful computational and informatics approaches for advancing scientific investigations in programming languages they use.
* Assist with development and maintenance of Earth Lab’s Analytics Hub, and instruct users on how to utilize the system.
* Participate in solutions around the integration of diverse remote sensing and in-situ datasets.
* Work with Earth Lab developers and cyber-infrastructure collaborators to optimize interoperability and long-term sustainability of these codebases and datasets as generalized resources for science researchers. 
* Participate in training efforts, including workshops for postdocs, graduate, or professional students.
