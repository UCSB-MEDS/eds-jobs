About AQUAOSO
AQUAOSO Technologies, PBC is a startup, a Techstars company, a Nature Conservancy partner, and a critical data partner to hundreds of paying users throughout the Finance & Agriculture supply chain. Our experienced team is working towards a water resilient future. We build ethical technology to tackle 21st century water issues.
As a public benefit corporation we believe that people, place, and community matter. By shining the light on water data, we can increase decision-maker ability to form intelligent, informed decisions about their business, government district, farm, or investment by providing actionable intelligence in mitigating risks associated with water.
Turning raw data into refined catalysts for action is a messy process. We take on the dirty job of wading through unorganized and hard to locate data. Just as you may find a valuable vintage item at a local yard sale, we are on the hunt for valuable data that can assist in improving our current platform. We then polish, analyze, and present actionable insights to our clients in a clean, clear, concise manner. Data alone is not useful; the right data, in the right format, at the right time is invaluable. We have fun, work hard and are growing a new company with a bright, cross-disciplinary team.
